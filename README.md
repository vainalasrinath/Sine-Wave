# Sine-Wave
sine wave generator using python
Overview
Sine waves represent periodic oscillations.
 

Sine waves have the shape of sine curve.
 

The X-axis of the sine curve represents the time.
 

The Y-axis of the sine curve represents the amplitude of the sine wave.
 

The amplitude of the sine wave at any point in Y is proportional to the sine of a variable.
 

The sine wave is given by the equation
A sin(ωt)

A - Amplitude

t - Time

The sine curve goes through origin.

A cycle of sine wave is complete when the position of the sine wave starts from a position 
and comes to the same position after attaining its maximum and minimum amplitude during its course.
 

The time taken to complete one cycle is called the period of the sine wave.
 

The frequency of the sine wave is given by number of cycles per second.
 

‘A’ denotes amplitude of a sine wave.
 

The distance covered by a cycle measures the wavelength of the sine wave.
 

The wavelength of the sine wave is denoted by λ.
 

Examples of sine waves include the oscillations produced by the suspended weight on spring and the alternating current.
 

NumPy has the sin() function, which takes an array of values and provides the sine value for them.
 

Using the numpy sin() function and the matplotlib plot()a sine wave can be drawn.
